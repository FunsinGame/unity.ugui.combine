## Project Overview
Enable UGUI to render the entire UI interface in a single draw call, similar to UI Toolkit.

## Core Features
Compatible with all UGUI components and TMP_UI elements.

Merge toggle can be enabled or disabled in real time, with per-Canvas or per-component granularity.

Supports exporting built-in Sprites; components default to referencing external atlases.

Currently supports only TMP_SDF-Mobile.shader for TextMeshPro.

Compatible with RectMask2D merging.

## Future Plans
Support for more comprehensive TMP parameters.
